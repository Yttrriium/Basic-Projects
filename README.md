# Basic-Projects
A few projects that are medium as difficulty, but for my current level of programming they are a challenge.

1) Drink Water Reminder<br>
~A pretty basic project, but gave me a lot of insights into Python and its modules: Tkinter, Time, VLC<br>
Update 1: What seems a basic concept and task is not as easy as it should have been, lesson learned.<br>
Tkinter, an okey-ish module for Python, but quite not the thing I was particularly looking for, so i switched to PyGame...<br>
Update 2: The code was doing fine, it finally started to seem like a good product, but unfortunately i was reminded that I needed an .exe to run this code on other computers without Python....and after some research I got a solution, the module cx_Freeze.<br>
